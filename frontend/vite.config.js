/*proxy: { "/api": { target: "http://localhost:5000", ... } }
The proxy option is used to redirect API requests made from the frontend during development to another server. Here's how it works:

"/api": This means that any requests that start with /api will be proxied.
target: "http://localhost:5000": This is the target where the requests will be forwarded. In this case, itâ€™s a backend server running on http://localhost:5000*/
